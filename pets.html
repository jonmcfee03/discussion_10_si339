            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei" class="center-image">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <p>Rocket (also named huihui) is a 6-month pomeranian puppy 
                with big eyes and a small, black cute nose. Rocket is 
                named rocket because he runs so fast and energetic all 
                day without even having some rest. Rocket loves to carry 
                his little toy walking around the house and jumping towards my bed.</p> 
                
            <p>Rocket is friendly to all human beings. He will be a little shy at 
                first, but will 'say hi' to you after a few seconds. He is also
                friendly to dogs, especially the small breed, because the large
                size dogs are hard for him to smell lol. If you meet rocket, donâ€™t 
                hesitate to say hi to him!! He will be super happy the whole day.</p>

            class="center-image">    
                
            <p>Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. 
                He was found wandering alone and taken to the Valley 
                Humane Society where he found his new family. From a 
                young age, Pluto always had a special personality, he 
                was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of 
                his time staring out the window to keep watch of his 
                house. Don't let the laziness fool you because Pluto 
                defends his family from the mailman and squirrels every 
                single day.
            </p> 
                
            <p>Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes 
                to have fun. Pluto's favorite part of the day is his 
                daily walk. Sometimes he even gets to go to the park 
                and meet his neighbors. He also loves his toy duck, 
                and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature 
                to hunt and so he makes sure to get some practice with 
                his toy duck.</p>
